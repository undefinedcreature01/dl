# What even is artificial intelligence ?

**Artificial intelligence** is a field of computer science focused on developing and reaserching systems made to preform tasks that require human-like intelligence. (the term "AI" may also be used to describe such machines/software). 
Things like simple item classification (is this food, drink, a toy, a human face ?) and are all things computers cannot "just do"

-but neither can we.

Just like AIs we need to train and learn these things. Now it isn't unexpected that a thing made to mimic and even surpass human intelligence needs to train like one too, yet having tons of data inserted into the brain wasn't really a part of anyones childhood now was it ? (it actually was!) 

As children we explore our environment and adapt to it. Simple games like fitting blocks of diffrent shapes through holes or recognizing when our friends are happy or sad are all experiences which we learn from. In other words we took the data given to us by our environment and learnt something from it. 
Now unlike humans, that learn, know and do all of these tasks at once, AIs are generally quite specialized, often designed to learn and preform only one task(or a small range of tasks). For example just recognizing emotions or just recognizing shapes. We call such specilized AIs **narrow or "weak" AIs.**

(opposite: general AIs ; able to learn, understand and adapt - learn from experience, adapt to new/different situations ... //currently only a goal in the field of AI)
