# What even is artificial intelligence ?

**Artificial intelligence** is a branch of computer science focused on developing and reaserching systems made to preform tasks that require human-like intelligence. <br>
(the term "AI" may also be used to describe such machines/software). 

AIs are generally quite specialized, often designed to preform only one task(or a small range of tasks). For example just recognizing emotions or just recognizing shapes. We call such specilized AIs **narrow or "weak" AIs.**

(opposite: general AIs ; able to learn, understand and adapt - learn from experience, adapt to new/different situations ... currently only a goal in the field of AI)

# Machine learning

AI is all about making systems able to preform tasks that generally require human-like intelligence right ? <br>

So machine learning is focused on achiving that with the development of algorithms and models that enable systems to preform those tasks without being programmed with specific rules on how to preform them, but rather by learning on specific datasets and applying that to new data.

| |   |
|---|---|
| dataset | collection of data  |
|  labled data | label-data pairs where the label corresponds to the data |
| label | the desired output of a system in a labled dataset (ie. answer, category) |
| features  |  relevant/useful information about specific instance of data (ie. edges of a picture, pitch of a sound) |
|   |   |

#### Methods

| Learning paradigms||
|-|-|
| Supervised learning      | algorithm is trained on labled training data (tries getting closer to the correct label)                  |
| Unsupervised learning    | algorithm is trained on unlabled training data - discoveres patterns by itself                               |
| Semi-Supervised learning | algorithm is trained on both labled and unlabled data <br> (usually used when labled data is scarce/expensive)             |
| Reinforcement learning   | algorithm is trained by interacting - receiving feedback (rewards/penalties) 

There are types of methods that (can) utlize more than one learning paradigm, and do not fit very well into this categorization.

|||
|-|-|
| Feature/representation learning      | algorithm automatically identifies/extracts features from raw data <br> (unsupervised, supervised)     

|Models||
|-|-|
| (Artificial) Neural networks - (A)NNs||

## Neural Networks



# Deep learning

So machine learning is all about using algorithms and such to make computers preform the tasks. <br> When we talk about deep learning these algorithms and models utilize things called *neural networks* with many *layers* ("deep" networks).
# AI vs. machine learing vs. deep learning ?

! some  grammar lessons are needed here !
<br> (these terms are often used interchangeably making everything confusing)

| | |
|---|---|
| field | broad topic/area of study (wide range of research and practice) |
| subfield  | a smaller, more specialized area of study withing a field (often emerge as a field grows/becomes more complex) |

Computer science is the **FIELD** here. A broad area of study spanning a VERY wide veriaiety of topics (ie. AI, networking, databases)

So Artificial intelligence is the **SUBFIELD** of computer science.
Because AI in itself spans through a very wide veriaiety of themes it's a **FIELD** in its own right.

Which then means machine learning (ML) is a **SUBFIELD** of AI, but it's complex enough to be a **FIELD** of its own. (confused yet ?)

Deep learning (DL) is then a "sub-subfield" of AI, but also just a **SUBFIELD** of machine learning, it also utilizes other subfields in machine learning so we often refer to it as a "subset".

Many **SUBFIELDS** of AI (and even machine learning) **use** machine learning methods. 
(they are still specialized areas of the study of artificial intelligence (not subfields of machine learning), they just aren't truly "standalone").
